# Greetings and Felicitations!

Welcome, and let me begin to introduce myself. I'd explain my background, but it's been so varied that it wouldn't make sense all at once. Suffice it to say, I grew up near the Atlantic Ocean on coastal Maine. My best friend and I were nerds who made our own computer games when we got tired of the shareware that came on floppy disks. Between then and now, I've transitioned several times and now work in the mental health field and still have a hobby of tinkering with technology. More details will emerge about my life as we go. All aboard for this long strange trip, and we'll see where it ends up!
