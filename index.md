# Hi, I’m @mainethor
- I was once a developer, I won't tell you how long ago to try to avoid ageism, but I started on GWBASIC and later QBASIC, if that gives you an idea. I took some time away from developing for a while, doing lots of different things, but never strayed away from tinkering. I run various flavors of Linux, Windows, and Android, do some shell scripts, HTML, PHP, Python, R, VBA scripts in Excel, whatever will get the job I'm trying to do done. I worked for an Electronic Health Records company for almost 7 years, specializing in the ANSI 835 files received from payers and the automation surrounding applying the payments to the correct patient's accounts and claims. Now I'm working in a residential facility caring for mentally handicapped adults. 

-  I’m interested in contributing to some open source projects that interest me, perhaps adding to or streamlining features of software that I'm familiar with.
-  I’m currently learning more languages and more efficient ways of doing things. I like data analytics, open source software, and things that contribute to society.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on open source audio programs, EHR/EMR systems, or bugfixes in old abandoned code.
